The Profit Fish Project (200 pts)\nWorth: 200 points (25% of grade)\nTeam Size: 3-4 students\nDuration: 10 weeks (Feb 25 - May 8)\n\nProject Mission\nDesign and pitch an innovative economic solution to a real-world market problem. Your solution should apply microeconomic principles—especially supply, demand, pricing, and profit maximization—to solve an economic challenge.\n\n\nProject Philosophy\nWe’re not looking for the most high-tech startup idea. We’re looking for economic thinking applied to real problems. The best Profit Fish projects show:\n\nClear problem identification backed by research\nRealistic market analysis with actual willingness-to-pay data\nSound economic logic in pricing and costs\nHonest profit analysis including sensitivity to price changes\n\n\n\nProject Phases\n\nPhase 1: Problem Identification (Due March 6)\nDeliverable: 1-2 page proposal\nRequirements: - Define the economic problem clearly - Explain why it matters (market size, customer pain points) - Identify your team members and their roles - Provide initial bibliography (3+ sources)\nExample Problems: - High transaction costs in [industry] → create a marketplace - Information asymmetry in [market] → design better transparency - Underutilized capacity in [service] → match supply to demand - Geographic arbitrage opportunity → logistics solution - Externality not priced → internalize costs through business model\n\n\nPhase 2: Market Research & Analysis (Due April 10)\nDeliverable: 3-5 page progress report + supporting data\nRequirements: - Market Size: How many potential customers? What’s the addressable market? - Willingness to Pay: Survey or research data on what customers would pay - Competition: Who else addresses this? How are you different? - Supply-Side Analysis: What will it cost to provide this solution? - Initial Profit Estimate: Rough revenue - costs = profit\nData to Gather: - Customer interviews (at least 5) - Competitor pricing research - Cost estimates for production/delivery - Market size estimates from industry reports\n\n\nPhase 3: Economic Analysis & Refinement (Due May 1)\nDeliverable: 10-15 page report with economic models + Excel spreadsheet\nRequirements:\nA. Cost Analysis - Fixed costs (one-time investments) - Variable costs (per unit) - Cost function: TC = FC + (VC × Q) - Break-even analysis: Q* where profit = 0\nB. Revenue Analysis - Base case: expected price × expected quantity - Sensitivity analysis: How does demand change with price? - Revenue function: TR = P × Q\nC. Profit Analysis - Profit = TR - TC = (P × Q) - (FC + VC × Q) - Calculate profit at different price points - Identify optimal price for profit maximization\nD. Elasticity - Estimate price elasticity of demand - What happens if price increases 10%? - How sensitive is profit to demand changes?\nE. Market Dynamics - How will competitors respond? - Will market conditions change? - What’s your competitive advantage?\nSupporting Excel Spreadsheet: - Row 1: Unit costs, fixed costs, price, quantity - Rows 2-20: Break-even analysis (varying Q) - Graph: Cost, Revenue, Profit curves - Sensitivity table: Profit at different prices/quantities\n\n\nPhase 4: Final Presentation (May 6-8)\nDeliverable: 10-minute live presentation + final written submission\nPresentation Components:\n\nThe Problem (2 min)\n\nShow why this problem matters\nReal customer story or data\nMarket gap you’re filling\n\nThe Solution (2 min)\n\nWhat you’re selling\nWhy it’s better than alternatives\nHow it works (one customer example)\n\nThe Economics (3 min)\n\nYour pricing strategy\nCost structure\nProfit at scale\nBreak-even timeline\n\nThe Pitch (2 min)\n\nCall to action\nWhy YOU can execute this\nVision for growth\n\nQ&A (1 min)\n\nBe ready to defend your assumptions\n\n\nPresentation Format: - 3’ × 4’ poster board (or equivalent digital poster) - Professional one-page pamphlet - Excel model/calculations visible - Color, visuals, data-driven\n\n\n\nProfit Fish Scoring Rubric (200 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nPoints\nExcellent (40)\nGood (32)\nSatisfactory (24)\nNeeds Work (16)\nIncomplete (0)\n\n\n\n\nProblem Identification & Persuasion\n40\nProblem is clear, compelling, well-researched; audience understands urgency and market opportunity\nProblem is clear and meaningful; good market research; minor gaps\nProblem stated but research is thin; reasoning could be stronger\nProblem vague; limited market research or understanding\nNo clear problem\n\n\nMarket Analysis & Demand\n40\nExcellent customer research; realistic WTP estimates; supported by data/interviews; market size justified\nGood customer insights; reasonable WTP; adequate market sizing\nBasic market analysis; some customer data; rough estimates\nMinimal market analysis; weak demand justification\nNo market analysis\n\n\nSolution Quality & Differentiation\n40\nSolution elegantly solves problem; clearly differentiated; feasible and innovative\nSolution addresses problem well; competitive advantage clear; realistic\nSolution addresses problem; some competition acknowledged; feasibility questions\nSolution somewhat unclear; competition not well understood\nNo clear solution\n\n\nEconomic Analysis\n40\nRigorous cost, revenue, profit analysis; correct elasticity calculation; sophisticated modeling; sensitivity analysis\nAccurate economic calculations; good cost and revenue model; proper profit analysis\nEconomic analysis present; calculations mostly correct; basic modeling\nEconomic calculations have errors; incomplete analysis\nNo economic analysis\n\n\nPresentation & Clarity\n40\nPolished, professional presentation; clear communication; compelling visuals; audience engaged; excellent delivery\nWell-organized presentation; clear messaging; good visuals; solid delivery\nAdequate presentation; generally clear; some visual issues; acceptable delivery\nPresentation disorganized or unclear; weak visuals; delivery issues\nNo presentation or unintelligible"

Authorized absences do not relieve the student of class responsibilities. Prior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsoring department.”\n\nFederal Financial Aid Compliance\nRegardless of whether attendance is required for your course, instructors are still responsible for tracking student attendance/activity to meet federal financial aid requirements. Specifically, faculty must be able to report a student’s last date of attendance or academic activity if they stop participating or do not complete the course.\n\n\nReligious Observances and Authorized Absences\nNMSU values diversity and the university supports cultural and religious inclusiveness. If your participation in cultural or religious observances (e.g. religious holidays, spiritual observances) conflicts with a particular class session, please notify the instructor in writing and ahead of time to be excused from class for such observances.\n\n\nExam Attendance\nYou are STRONGLY encouraged to study for and take all in-class exams. If you miss an in-class exam for ANY reason (with the exception of official university business) then that missed exam will be counted as your dropped or lowest. For any future missed exams, you will earn a zero (0) for the missed exam. THERE ARE NO MAKE-UP IN-CLASS EXAMS OR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS. Also note that it is very difficult to anticipate every possible situation that may arise, so please contact me immediately if an exceptional situation arises."

See ARP 4.55 Part 2 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html) for more information.\n\n\n6-Week Early Performance Grades\nLower division courses are required to submit grades for work completed as of the sixth (6th) Friday of the semester.

Authorized absences do not relieve the student of class responsibilities. Prior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsoring department.”\n\nFederal Financial Aid Compliance\nRegardless of whether attendance is required for your course, instructors are still responsible for tracking student attendance/activity to meet federal financial aid requirements. Specifically, faculty must be able to report a student’s last date of attendance or academic activity if they stop participating or do not complete the course.\n\n\nReligious Observances and Authorized Absences\nNMSU values diversity and the university supports cultural and religious inclusiveness. If your participation in cultural or religious observances (e.g. religious holidays, spiritual observances) conflicts with a particular class session, please notify the instructor in writing and ahead of time to be excused from class for such observances.\n\n\nAttendance and Make-Up Work\nYou are STRONGLY encouraged to study for and complete all in-class worksheets and activities. If you miss an in-class assignment for ANY reason you need to email the TA, provide documentation, and schedule a time to take a make-up worksheet. Note that it is very difficult to anticipate every possible situation that may arise, so please contact me immediately if an exceptional situation arises.\n\n\n\nNotebook\n\nEntries accepted through May 8 (end of class)\nWeekly entries should be submitted Friday (during class or by 11:59 PM if digital)\nLate entries deduct 2 points per entry submitted late"

At the request of the student, the instructor will provide information on progress in the course prior to the last day to drop a course.\n\nIncomplete Grades\nUnder university policy, incompletes may be given only if a student has a passing grade at midsemester (the last day to withdraw from a class) and is precluded from successful completion of the second half of the course by a documented illness, documented death, family crisis or other similar circumstances beyond the student’s control. Visit ARP 4.55 Part 2, Letter D (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html) for more information.\n\n\nS/U Grading\nStudents enrolling under the S/U grading option must earn a specific grade as designated by the instructor to receive an “S”.

See ARP 4.55 Part 2 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html) for more information.\n\n\n6-Week Early Performance Grades\nLower division courses are required to submit grades for work completed as of the sixth (6th) Friday of the semester.

We explore the nature of scarcity, trade-offs, and rational decision-making, along with the fundamental principles that shape our economic world.\nMicroeconomics is the study of decision-making at the individual and firm level. How do consumers choose what to buy? How do firms decide what to produce? How do markets bring these decisions together? This course explores the big questions through 15 fundamental economic concepts."

Authorized absences do not relieve the student of class responsibilities.

If your participation in cultural or religious observances (e.g. religious holidays, spiritual observances) conflicts with a particular class session, please notify the instructor in writing and ahead of time to be excused from class for such observances.\n\n\nAttendance and Make-Up Work\nYou are STRONGLY encouraged to study for and complete all in-class worksheets and activities. If you miss an in-class assignment for ANY reason you need to email the TA, provide docoumentation, and schedule a time to take a make-up worksheet.
