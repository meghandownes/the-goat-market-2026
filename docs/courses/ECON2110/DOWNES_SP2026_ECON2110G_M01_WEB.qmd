## Course Description

This course introduces students to the principles of macroeconomics, including analysis of aggregate demand and supply, growth models, monetary policy, and fiscal policy. Through a combination of traditional lectures, interactive worksheets, hands-on experiments, and a capstone project, students will develop an understanding of how macroeconomic principles shape real-world policy decisions. The course emphasizes critical thinking, quantitative literacy, and practical application of economic theory.

Macroeconomics is the study of decision-making at the economy-wide level. How do economies grow? What determines price levels and inflation? How do governments and central banks influence economic outcomes? This course explores these big questions through 15 fundamental economic concepts.
