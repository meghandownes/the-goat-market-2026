**Total Points:** 200 (Policy Brief: 100 | Presentation: 75 | Peer Evaluation: 25)  
**Due Date:** Week 15 (May 7, 2026)  
**Group Size:** 2-3 students

## Project Overview

This capstone project asks you to develop and defend a policy recommendation for addressing a major macroeconomic challenge. You'll research different policy approaches, analyze them through the lens of economic theories you've learned, and present evidence-based arguments for why your recommended approach is the "Greatest Approach of All Time" (GOAT).

---

## Part A: Policy Brief (100 points)

A comprehensive written analysis (2,000-2,500 words) including:

### 1. Executive Summary (150-200 words)
- Clear statement of the macroeconomic issue
- Why it matters
- Your recommended policy approach
- Expected outcomes

### 2. Issue Definition & Background (400-500 words)

**Cover:**
- What is the specific economic problem?
- Historical context: How did we get here?
- Current data and trends
- Who is affected and how?
- Why does this problem matter?

**Include:**

- Key statistics and figures
- Timeline of the problem if relevant

### 3. Theoretical Analysis (600-700 words)

**Analyze the problem through multiple economic lenses:**

**Theory 1: [e.g., Keynesian Economics]**
- How does this theory explain the problem?
- What policies does this theory suggest?
- Strengths of this approach
- Limitations of this approach

**Theory 2: [e.g., Monetarism]**

- What policies does this theory suggest?
- Strengths of this approach
- Limitations of this approach

  - [Disadvantage 1]
  - [Disadvantage 2]
- Real-world examples (case studies, countries, time periods)
- Estimated costs/benefits

**Option B: [Policy Name]**
- [Same structure as Option A]

**Option C: [Policy Name]**
- [Same structure as Option A]

*Optional:* Option D or E if comparing many approaches

### 5. Your Recommendation & Justification (400-500 words)

**This is your GOAT argument:**

- Which policy do you recommend and why?
- Why is this the "Greatest Approach of All Time" for this issue?
- How does it address the root causes identified in your analysis?
- What does economic theory predict about its effectiveness?
- What evidence supports your choice?

**Address:**
- Why you rejected the other options
- Potential criticisms of your approach and how you'd respond
- How this policy compares to historical attempts
- Expected outcomes and timeline

### 6. Implementation Considerations (200-300 words)

- Who would implement this policy?
