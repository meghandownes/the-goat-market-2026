Monetary Policy Project (200 pts)\nWorth: 200 points (25% of grade)\nTeam Size: 3-4 students\nDuration: 10 weeks (Feb 25 - May 8)\n\nProject Mission\nAnalyze a major Federal Reserve monetary policy decision and evaluate its effectiveness. Your analysis should apply monetary economic principles to assess how and why the Fed made specific policy choices and what their economic impacts were.\n\n\nProject Philosophy\nWe’re not looking for purely academic exercises. We’re looking for economic thinking applied to real monetary policy decisions. The best projects show:\n\nClear understanding of the economic context when the decision was made\nRigorous application of monetary theory to explain Fed actions\nHonest assessment of policy effectiveness using real economic data\nThoughtful evaluation of alternative policy approaches the Fed might have considered\n\n\n\nProject Phases\n\nPhase 1: Policy Decision Identification (Due March 4)\nDeliverable: 1-2 page proposal\nRequirements: - Identify a significant Fed monetary policy decision (2008 financial crisis, 2020 pandemic response, recent rate changes, etc.) - Explain the economic context and why the decision was important - Describe what the Fed did (specific policy tools, magnitudes, timing) - Identify your team members and their roles - Provide initial bibliography (3+ sources)\nExamples of Major Decisions: - 2008-2009: Emergency lending facilities and quantitative easing - 2011-2014: Extended duration of low rates (“forward guidance”) - 2015-2018: Interest rate normalization - 2020: Pandemic emergency response - 2021-2023: Inflation and rate hiking cycle\n\n\nPhase 2: Economic Context & Theory (Due April 8)\nDeliverable: 3-5 page progress report + supporting data\nRequirements: - Economic Situation: What was happening in the economy? (inflation, unemployment, growth, financial stress) - Monetary Theory: Which economic theories explain the Fed’s decision? (Classical, Keynesian, Monetarist, etc.) - Policy Transmission: How do these policy tools work through the economy? - Alternative Theories: How would different theoretical perspectives have recommended different policies? - Initial Assessment: What do you predict will happen?\nData to Gather: - Fed press releases and FOMC statements - Economic indicators (inflation, employment, GDP growth) - Financial market data (interest rates, stock markets, credit spreads) - Academic papers analyzing the policy decision - Historical data before, during, and after the policy change\n\n\nPhase 3: Effectiveness Analysis & Evaluation (Due April 29)\nDeliverable: 10-15 page report with economic analysis + Excel spreadsheet\nRequirements:\nA. Timeline & Events - What exactly did the Fed do? (Specific policy tools, dates, magnitudes) - How was policy communicated? (Press releases, speeches, forward guidance) - How did markets react? (Interest rates, credit spreads, asset prices)\nB. Monetary Transmission Analysis - Interest rate channel: How did Fed policy affect interest rates throughout the economy? - Credit channel: How did policy affect bank lending and credit availability? - Asset price channel: How did policy affect stock prices, house prices, and other assets? - Exchange rate channel: How did policy affect the dollar and international trade? - Expectations channel: How did forward guidance shape economic expectations?\nC. Outcome Evaluation - Did inflation respond as predicted? - Did unemployment/employment respond as predicted? - Did growth respond as predicted? - Quantify the impacts using data (before/after comparisons, regressions if appropriate)\nD. Effectiveness Assessment - Did the policy achieve its stated goals? - Were there unintended consequences? - Could alternative policies have worked better? - What did we learn from this policy experience?\nE. Policy Comparison - How does this policy compare to historical precedent? - What would other economists have recommended? - Was the policy better or worse than the alternatives?\nSupporting Excel Spreadsheet: - Key economic data series over time - Graphs of policy effects (interest rates, inflation, employment, etc.) - Timeline of policy actions and market reactions - Summary statistics before/after policy change\n\n\nPhase 4: Final Presentation (May 4-8)\nDeliverable: 12-minute live presentation + final written submission\nPresentation Components:\n\nThe Economic Problem (2.5 min)\n\nEconomic conditions when Fed made decision\nWhy action was needed\nData showing severity of situation\n\nThe Policy Decision (2.5 min)\n\nWhat the Fed decided to do\nPolicy tools used\nWhy this approach makes economic sense\n\nThe Transmission (3 min)\n\nHow policy worked through the economy\nTimeline of effects\nData showing policy impacts\n\nThe Verdict (2.5 min)\n\nDid the policy work?\nSuccess in achieving goals\nTrade-offs or unintended consequences\nOverall assessment\n\nQ&A (1.5 min)\n\nBe ready to defend your analysis\nDiscuss alternative policies\n\n\nPresentation Format: - 3’ × 4’ poster board (or equivalent digital poster) - Professional one-page policy brief - Excel model/graphs visible - Clear timeline of events - Color, visuals, data-driven\n\n\n\nMonetary Policy Project Scoring Rubric (200 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nPoints\nExcellent (40)\nGood (32)\nSatisfactory (24)\nNeeds Work (16)\nIncomplete (0)\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Context & Understanding\n40\nThorough analysis of conditions; clear explanation of why Fed action was needed; excellent use of economic data\nGood understanding of context; solid economic analysis; adequate data\nBasic context described; economic logic present; some data\nLimited understanding of situation; weak economic reasoning\nNo context or understanding\n\n\nMonetary Theory & Analysis\n40\nSophisticated application of monetary theories; clear explanation of transmission mechanisms; considers multiple perspectives\nGood application of theory; clear transmission mechanism; addresses alternatives\nTheory applied; transmission mechanism explained; basic analysis\nTheory mentioned but weakly applied; incomplete transmission analysis\nNo theoretical analysis\n\n\nPolicy Evaluation\n40\nRigorous assessment of effectiveness; excellent use of before/after data; honest evaluation of trade-offs\nGood assessment of policy effects; solid data analysis; acknowledges trade-offs\nPolicy evaluated; outcomes described; basic analysis of effectiveness\nWeak evaluation; limited data; incomplete assessment\nNo evaluation or assessment\n\n\nPolicy Comparison\n40\nExcellent comparison to alternatives; considers multiple perspectives; thoughtful analysis of trade-offs\nGood comparison to alternatives; considers different approaches; reasonable analysis\nAlternatives mentioned; basic comparison\nLimited comparison to alternatives; weak analysis\nNo comparison or alternatives\n\n\nPresentation & Clarity\n40\nPolished, professional presentation; excellent communication; compelling visuals; audience engaged; excellent delivery\nWell-organized presentation; clear messaging; good visuals; solid delivery\nAdequate presentation; generally clear; some visual issues; acceptable delivery\nPresentation disorganized or unclear; weak visuals; delivery issues\nNo presentation or unintelligible",

Authorized absences do not relieve the student of class responsibilities. Prior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsoring department.”\n\nFederal Financial Aid Compliance\nRegardless of whether attendance is required for your course, instructors are still responsible for tracking student attendance/activity to meet federal financial aid requirements. Specifically, faculty must be able to report a student’s last date of attendance or academic activity if they stop participating or do not complete the course.\n\n\nReligious Observances and Authorized Absences\nNMSU values diversity and the university supports cultural and religious inclusiveness. If your participation in cultural or religious observances (e.g. religious holidays, spiritual observances) conflicts with a particular class session, please notify the instructor in writing and ahead of time to be excused from class for such observances.\n\n\nExam Attendance\nYou are STRONGLY encouraged to study for and take all in-class exams. If you miss an in-class exam for ANY reason (with the exception of official university business) then that missed exam will be counted as your dropped or lowest. For any future missed exams, you will earn a zero (0) for the missed exam. THERE ARE NO MAKE-UP IN-CLASS EXAMS OR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS. Also note that it is very difficult to anticipate every possible situation that may arise, so please contact me immediately if an exceptional situation arises."

At the request of the student, the instructor will provide information on progress in the course prior to the last day to drop a course.\n\nIncomplete Grades\nUnder university policy, incompletes may be given only if a student has a passing grade at midsemester (the last day to withdraw from a class) and is precluded from successful completion of the second half of the course by a documented illness, documented death, family crisis or other similar circumstances beyond the student’s control. Visit ARP 4.55 Part 2, Letter D (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html) for more information.\n\n\nS/U Grading\nStudents enrolling under the S/U grading option must earn a specific grade as designated by the instructor to receive an “S”. Students must elect the grading option prior to the last day to add a class. See ARP 4.55 Part 2 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html) for more information.\n\n\n6-Week Early Performance Grades\nLower division courses are required to submit grades for work completed as of the sixth (6th) Friday of the semester. These grades will be used to facilitate opportunities for students to address performance issues. This is optional for upper division courses.
