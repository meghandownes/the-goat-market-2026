## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to monetary economics, financial institutions, and monetary policy. We explore how the Federal Reserve system functions, how interest rates are determined, how banks create money, and how monetary policy affects the broader economy. Through lectures, case studies, interactive worksheets, hands-on experiments, and a capstone project, students develop a deep understanding of the financial system and monetary policy tools.

Money and Banking is the study of decision-making at the financial system level. How do central banks manage the money supply? What determines interest rates? How do monetary policy decisions affect inflation, employment, and economic growth? This course explores these critical questions through core economic principles applied to the financial sector.

At the request of the student, the instructor will provide information on progress in the course prior to the last day to drop a course.

### Incomplete Grades

Under university policy, incompletes may be given only if a student has a passing grade at midsemester (the last day to withdraw from a class) and is precluded from successful completion of the second half of the course by a documented illness, documented death, family crisis or other similar circumstances beyond the student's control. Visit ARP 4.55 Part 2, Letter D (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html) for more information.

### S/U Grading

Students enrolling under the S/U grading option must earn a specific grade as designated by the instructor to receive an "S". Students must elect the grading option prior to the last day to add a class. See ARP 4.55 Part 2 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html) for more information.

### 6-Week Early Performance Grades

# Final Thoughts

Money and banking are central to understanding modern economies. The Federal Reserve's decisions affect interest rates, inflation, employment, and growth. Financial crises reshape markets and livelihoods.
