## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive overview of microeconomics—the study of how individuals and firms make decisions, how markets work, and how prices coordinate economic activity. We explore the nature of scarcity, trade-offs, and rational decision-making, along with the fundamental principles that shape our economic world.

Microeconomics is the study of decision-making at the individual and firm level. How do consumers choose what to buy? How do firms decide what to produce? How do markets bring these decisions together? This course explores the big questions through 15 fundamental economic concepts.

**Team Size:** 3-4 students  
**Duration:** 10 weeks (Feb 26 - May 6)

### Project Mission

Design and pitch an innovative economic solution to a real-world market problem. Your solution should apply microeconomic principles—especially supply, demand, pricing, and profit maximization—to solve an economic challenge.

### Project Philosophy

We're not looking for the most high-tech startup idea. We're looking for economic thinking applied to real problems. The best Profit Fish projects show:

- Clear problem identification backed by research
- Realistic market analysis with actual willingness-to-pay data
- Sound economic logic in pricing and costs
- Honest profit analysis including sensitivity to price changes

**Requirements:**
- Define the economic problem clearly
- Explain why it matters (market size, customer pain points)
- Identify your team members and their roles
- Provide initial bibliography (3+ sources)

**Example Problems:**
- High transaction costs in [industry] → create a marketplace
- Information asymmetry in [market] → design better transparency
- Underutilized capacity in [service] → match supply to demand
- Geographic arbitrage opportunity → logistics solution
- Externality not priced → internalize costs through business model

#### Phase 2: Market Research & Analysis (Due April 8)

**Deliverable:** 3-5 page progress report + supporting data

**Requirements:**
- **Market Size:** How many potential customers? What's the addressable market?
- **Willingness to Pay:** Survey or research data on what customers would pay
- **Competition:** Who else addresses this? How are you different?
- **Supply-Side Analysis:** What will it cost to provide this solution?
- **Initial Profit Estimate:** Rough revenue - costs = profit

**Data to Gather:**
- Customer interviews (at least 5)
- Competitor pricing research
- Cost estimates for production/delivery
- Market size estimates from industry reports

#### Phase 3: Economic Analysis & Refinement (Due April 29)

**Deliverable:** 10-15 page report with economic models + Excel spreadsheet

**Requirements:**

**A. Cost Analysis**
- Fixed costs (one-time investments)
- Variable costs (per unit)
- Cost function: TC = FC + (VC × Q)
- Break-even analysis: Q* where profit = 0

**B. Revenue Analysis**
- Base case: expected price × expected quantity
- Sensitivity analysis: How does demand change with price?
- Revenue function: TR = P × Q

**C. Profit Analysis**
- Profit = TR - TC = (P × Q) - (FC + VC × Q)
- Calculate profit at different price points
- Identify optimal price for profit maximization

**D. Elasticity**
- Estimate price elasticity of demand
- What happens if price increases 10%?
- How sensitive is profit to demand changes?

**E. Market Dynamics**
- How will competitors respond?

**Supporting Excel Spreadsheet:**
- Row 1: Unit costs, fixed costs, price, quantity
- Rows 2-20: Break-even analysis (varying Q)
- Graph: Cost, Revenue, Profit curves

# Course Policies & Resources

## Academic Integrity

All work must be your own (or your group's in the case of Profit Fish).

Acceptable: Collaborating on understanding; discussing concepts; studying together

Not acceptable: Copying worksheets; submitting identical work; paraphrasing without understanding

**Consequences of academic dishonesty:**

- First offense: 0 on assignment + mandatory meeting
- Second offense: F in course + referral to Dean of Students

For more information, see the NMSU Student Handbook at http://studenthandbook.nmsu.edu/

---

## Class Attendance

According to NMSU policy:

"Students making satisfactory progress in their classes will be excused from classes when they are representing New Mexico State University at a university-sponsored event (e.g., ASNMSU President attending a legislative session, student-athletes participating in NMSU athletic events, students attending educational field trips or conferences). Authorized absences do not relieve the student of class responsibilities. Prior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsoring department."

### Federal Financial Aid Compliance

Regardless of whether attendance is required for your course, instructors are still responsible for tracking student attendance/activity to meet federal financial aid requirements. Specifically, faculty must be able to report a student's last date of attendance or academic activity if they stop participating or do not complete the course.

### Religious Observances and Authorized Absences

NMSU values diversity and the university supports cultural and religious inclusiveness. If your participation in cultural or religious observances (e.g. religious holidays, spiritual observances) conflicts with a particular class session, please notify the instructor in writing and ahead of time to be excused from class for such observances.

### Exam Attendance

You are STRONGLY encouraged to study for and take all in-class exams. If you miss an in-class exam for ANY reason (with the exception of official university business) then that missed exam will be counted as your dropped or lowest. For any future missed exams, you will earn a zero (0) for the missed exam. THERE ARE NO MAKE-UP IN-CLASS EXAMS OR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS. Also note that it is very difficult to anticipate every possible situation that may arise, so please contact me immediately if an exceptional situation arises.

## University Grading System

The University Grading System is outlined in ARP 4.55 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html). Instructors can decide if their course is graded using fractional grading (pluses and minuses). At the request of the student, the instructor will provide information on progress in the course prior to the last day to drop a course.

### Incomplete Grades

Under university policy, incompletes may be given only if a student has a passing grade at midsemester (the last day to withdraw from a class) and is precluded from successful completion of the second half of the course by a documented illness, documented death, family crisis or other similar circumstances beyond the student's control. Visit ARP 4.55 Part 2, Letter D (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html) for more information.

### S/U Grading

Students enrolling under the S/U grading option must earn a specific grade as designated by the instructor to receive an "S". Students must elect the grading option prior to the last day to add a class. See ARP 4.55 Part 2 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html) for more information.

### 6-Week Early Performance Grades

Lower division courses are required to submit grades for work completed as of the sixth (6th) Friday of the semester. These grades will be used to facilitate opportunities for students to address performance issues. This is optional for upper division courses. (ARP 4.55, Part 5 https://arp.nmsu.edu/chapter-4/4-55.html).

# Course Philosophy

This course embraces the idea that economics is everywhere. Every decision you make involves economic thinking. By understanding the principles in this course, you'll see the world differently—recognizing the incentives, constraints, and trade-offs that shape our lives.

"Better Decisions -- That's What Economics is All About."

Our 15 G.O.A.T topics build from foundational concepts (scarcity, opportunity cost, marginal thinking) through consumer and producer behavior, to market dynamics and real-world applications. Each topic connects to the next, creating a comprehensive understanding of how economies work.
