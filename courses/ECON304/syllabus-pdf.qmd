## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to monetary economics, financial institutions, and monetary policy. We explore how the Federal Reserve system functions, how interest rates are determined, how banks create money, and how monetary policy affects the broader economy. Through lectures, case studies, interactive worksheets, hands-on experiments, and a capstone project, students develop a deep understanding of the financial system and monetary policy tools.

Money and Banking is the study of decision-making at the financial system level. How do central banks manage the money supply? What determines interest rates? How do monetary policy decisions affect inflation, employment, and economic growth? This course explores these critical questions through core economic principles applied to the financial sector.
