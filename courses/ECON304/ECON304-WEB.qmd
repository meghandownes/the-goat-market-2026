## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to monetary economics, financial institutions, and monetary policy. We explore how the Federal Reserve system functions, how interest rates are determined, how banks create money, and how monetary policy affects the broader economy. Through lectures, case studies, interactive worksheets, hands-on experiments, and a capstone project, students develop a deep understanding of the financial system and monetary policy tools.

Money and Banking is the study of decision-making at the financial system level. How do central banks manage the money supply? What determines interest rates? How do monetary policy decisions affect inflation, employment, and economic growth? This course explores these critical questions through core economic principles applied to the financial sector.

# Course Policies & Resources

## Academic Integrity

All work must be your own (or your group's in the case of the Monetary Policy Project).

Acceptable: Collaborating on understanding; discussing concepts; studying together

Not acceptable: Copying worksheets; submitting identical work; paraphrasing without understanding

**Consequences of academic dishonesty:**

- First offense: 0 on assignment + mandatory meeting
- Second offense: F in course + referral to Dean of Students

This course assumes that all work submitted by students will be generated by the students themselves, working individually or in groups. Students should not have another person/entity do the writing of any substantive portion of an assignment for them, which includes hiring a person or a company to write assignments and using AI tools.

---

## Communication & Course Expectations

### Response Time

I will typically respond to emails within 24 hours during weekdays. Messages sent after 5 PM Friday may not receive responses until the following Monday.

### Attendance & Participation

Success in this course requires regular attendance and active participation. Class activities, discussions, and worksheets are core to learning.

- Attend class regularly
