## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive overview of microeconomics—the study of how individuals and firms make decisions, how markets work, and how prices coordinate economic activity. We explore the nature of scarcity, trade-offs, and rational decision-making, along with the fundamental principles that shape our economic world.

Microeconomics is the study of decision-making at the individual and firm level. How do consumers choose what to buy? How do firms decide what to produce? How do markets bring these decisions together? This course explores the big questions through 15 fundamental economic concepts.

This course embraces the idea that economics is everywhere. Every decision you make involves economic thinking. By understanding the principles in this course, you'll see the world differently—recognizing the incentives, constraints, and trade-offs that shape our lives.

"Better Decisions -- That's What Economics is All About."
