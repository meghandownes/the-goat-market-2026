# ECON 2120: Principles of Microeconomics

## Course Overview

This course introduces the economic principles governing individual consumers, firms, and markets. You'll learn how supply and demand determine prices, how consumers make decisions, why firms behave the way they do, and how different market structures affect competition and pricing. These concepts form the foundation for understanding how economies allocate resources and create value.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Apply supply and demand analysis to real markets
- Understand consumer preferences and utility maximization
- Analyze firm behavior and profit maximization
- Evaluate market structures and competitive strategies
- Calculate elasticity and understand its economic implications
- Apply microeconomic principles to current business and policy decisions
