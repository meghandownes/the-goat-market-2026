### Tips for Strong Reflections

1. **Be Specific:** Don't just say "this was interesting." Say what was interesting and why.

2. **Make Connections:** Explicitly link your observations to what we discussed in class.

3. **Use Examples:** Real examples make your reflection more compelling and demonstrate deeper understanding.

4. **Be Honest:** Your genuine thoughts and questions are more valuable than what you think we want to hear.

5. **Show Growth:** How has your thinking evolved? What's different now that you didn't understand before?

6. **Look Outward:** Economics isn't just academic—it's everywhere. Connect concepts to news, politics, business, personal finance.

**Reminder:** These reflections are for your own learning first, and for us to understand your thinking second. There's no "wrong" answer to a reflection if you've engaged genuinely with the material.
